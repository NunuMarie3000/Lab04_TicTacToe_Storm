# Tic Tac Toe (Lab 04_Code401)

## What Is This?

Tic Tac Toe (Lab 04_Code401) was my Lab 4 assignment for Code School, course 401. It was a homework assignment to provide more practice with classes and object oriented programming in c#

## What Does It Look Like?

Tic Tac Toe is build with a collection of different classes: Game, Position, Board, and Player working with one another. It's a console application that was mostly starter code provided as a template. I was given the separate classes and methods, some were fully functional, some had bugs, and others weren't written at all. The pieces missing were:

1. overall game functionality
2. new player instantiation
3. game instantiation
4. checking for the winner
5. finding the winner

## How Do You Use It?

When you run the "dotnet run" command in the console, you'll see the welcome game line. You'll be prompted to enter the name of the first player, who will be X, then the second player, who will be O. The game follows as traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, whoever gets three in a row first is the winner. To claim a space, the player will be notified that it's their turn, then they'll be prompted to select a location on the board. The board is numbered 1-9 in a grid and the user can type in the number corresponding with the spot they'd like to claim. If all spaces are filled without a win, the game is declared a draw. The winner will be congratulated at the end of the game.

## Relevant Details

This lab was my first time really working with classes in c#; learning more about what they are and how to use them.
